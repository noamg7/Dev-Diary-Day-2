Reflect:
1. How do you feel about your first webpage?
I think my first web page needs to show more than just a "body."
2. What was the most difficult aspect of creating the html page?
The most difficult aspect is remembering the steps, I hope with more practice it will become second nature.
3. What, if anything, do you still have questions about?
I need a complete list of steps

Review
1. What is DOCTYPE?
type of document
2. what is the difference between <head> and <body>
<head> are the icons
<body> is the content of the web
